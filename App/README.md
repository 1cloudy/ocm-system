Open Charge Map - Mobile and Web App
=======

This is the Open Charge Map web application for general use on Mobile and Desktop browsers or packaging as Mobile app. The live version of this app is available at [http://openchargemap.org/app/](http://openchargemap.org/app/)

The app is HTML/CSS/JavaScript and currently uses [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and the [jQuery Mobile Icon Pack](https://github.com/commadelimited/jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack)

The production build of the app is built using the Jake build system under NodeJS. The mobile version is distributed via mobile app stores and is the standard build wrapped in a default PhoneGap/Apache Cordova wrapper. The app can easily be adapted to produce Network/Operator specific versions which are filtered to specific branded charging networks etc.

Note: source for this application was previously hosted at Sourceforge:
