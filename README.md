Open Charge Map
==========

Open Charge Map is the global public registry of electric vehicle charging locations. 

The aim of the project is to remove the need to maintain silos of privately held charging equipment location data and instead crowd source a high quality, well maintained data set with the greatest breadth possible.

This code here represents the backend systems (API, Web Site and Import Processing) for the project as well as the source for a mobile/web app and example client code in various programming languages.
