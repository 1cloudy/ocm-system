<h2>Our Service</h2>
<p>Open Charge Map is a non-commercial, non-profit, electric vehicle data service hosted and supported by a community of businesses, charities, developers and interested parties around the world.</p>
@Html.Partial("_TermsLink")

<h2>Our Aim</h2>
<p>Our aim is to work with the community to develop and provide a high quality, public, free, open database of charging equipment locations globally.</p>
<p>
    Our goal is to avoid the proliferation of independent conflicting charging location maps/websites/applications
    and to provide (as much as possible) a reliable single point of reference for charging equipment location information.
    Instead of competing with other data providers we aim to cooperate with and provide services to them, in exchange for
    data sharing and de-duplication efforts.
</p>
<h2>Why Use Open Charge Map?</h2>
<p>By using Open Charge Map and related apps you are helping to improve the information in the registry by providing peer review, edits, additions, comments, photos and by promoting the service to other users. The benefit of OCM over others providers is that OCM's purpose is to share information openly, whereas commercial providers have to keep their information to themselves (or within the confines of their own App etc.) in order to maintain a commercially marketable data set.</p>
